## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You've been developing a **Neurodivergent-Focused Job Search Automation Platform** that solves daily site-hopping overwhelm through unified job aggregation and personalized morning reports, with integrated executive function support and mental health features.

**Key Differentiator:** "You're not lazy. You just need tools built for how your brain works."

**Your Unique Position:**
- ✅ Lived experience (bipolar + ADHD + current job seeker)
- ✅ 3+ diverse neurodivergent testers ready
- ✅ Technical skills (Salesforce, data analysis, process improvement)
- ✅ Brilliant resume review prompt already developed
- ✅ Impact-first motivation (family + community driven)

---

## CORE CONCEPT

### The Problem You're Solving

**For Neurodivergent Job Seekers:**
- Overwhelming executive function burden of searching multiple sites daily
- Decision paralysis from too many options and steps
- Burnout from repetitive, scattered searching (Indeed, LinkedIn, company sites)
- Hidden shame of feeling "lazy" when the system wasn't built for their brains
- Mental health challenges affecting job search (mood cycling, anxiety, imposter syndrome)

**Market Gap Identified:**
- **Existing automation tools** (LazyApply, LoopCV, Sonara, JobCopilot): Focus on application speed, not cognitive overwhelm
- **Neurodivergent job platforms** (Mentra, Neuro Hire Network): Focus on job matching, not automation
- **Missing:** Automation designed specifically for executive function challenges

### Your Solution

**Unified Job Search Platform that:**
1. Aggregates jobs from multiple sources overnight
2. Filters based on neurodivergent-specific criteria (skills, sensory needs, company culture)
3. Delivers personalized morning summary reports
4. Removes the cognitive burden of daily site-hopping
5. Integrates mental health support for job search anxiety
6. Provides executive function support (task breaking, decision-making help)

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Tech Stack (From Previous Discussions)

**Backend:**
- Python (for automation, web scraping)
- Database (store jobs, user preferences, tracking data)
- Scheduled tasks (cron jobs or cloud scheduler)
- Web scraping libraries (Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Scrapy)

**APIs to Integrate:**
- Job boards (Indeed API, LinkedIn API if available)
- Email delivery (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Calendar integrations (Google Calendar API for interview scheduling)

- Database hosting (PostgreSQL on cloud or managed service)

**Development Tools:**
- Version control: GitHub
- Project management: Notion, Trello, or GitHub Projects

### MVP Implementation Strategy

**Option A: Email-Only MVP (Simplest)**
- Backend automation runs overnight
- Email reports sent in morning
- Users reply to email to configure preferences
- No web interface required initially

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Makes This Viable (Despite Challenges)

**1. Lived Experience = Authentic Credibility**
- You're building for yourself first
- You understand the pain deeply
- Bipolar + ADHD combo is underserved
- Can't fake this authenticity

**2. Clear Differentiation**
- NO ONE else combines job search automation + executive function support + mental health
- Existing tools solve different problems
- Your angle is unique and defensible

**3. Impact-First Model Removes Pressure**
- Not trying to build $100M company
- Sustainable small business or free tool
- Success = helping thousands, not millions
- Reduces stress and allows focus

**4. Testing Advantage**
- 3+ diverse testers ready to validate
- Real neurodivergent users from day 1
- Unbeatable marketing ("built by/for community")
- Free, authentic user research

**5. Technical Skills Match**
- You have Salesforce admin experience (data management)
- Process improvement background (40% efficiency gains)
- Data analytics skills (SQL, reporting)
- Understanding of automation
- Can learn Python or hire developer

**6. Family Motivation**
- Personal connection (helping community you're part of)
- Desire to create impact beyond yourself
- Sustainable long-term motivation
- Not just money-driven

### What Could Derail This

**1. Scope Creep**
- Trying to build everything at once
- Adding too many features too fast
- Perfectionism preventing launch
- **Mitigation:** Start with email-only MVP, iterate

**2. Mental Health Liability**
- Unclear boundaries between supportive and clinical
- User crisis situations
- Legal exposure
- **Mitigation:** Phase 1 = non-clinical only, clear disclaimers, prominent crisis resources

**3. Technical Complexity**
- Web scraping is fragile (sites change)
- API access limitations
- Scaling challenges
- **Mitigation:** Start small, validate manually before automating, use existing APIs where possible

**4. Market Willingness to Pay**
- Target audience often financially stressed
- Existing free resources available
- **Mitigation:** Free or pay-once model, focus on value over revenue

**5. Burnout Risk**
- You're job searching AND building product
- Managing bipolar/ADHD while stressed
- Solo founder challenges
- **Mitigation:** Pace yourself, build in public for accountability, enlist testers as collaborators
