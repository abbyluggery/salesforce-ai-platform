This guide explains how to use the **Job Search Skill** and **Neurodivergent Job Search Skill** together for maximum effectiveness.

## When to Use Which Skill

### Use Job Search Skill Alone When:
- You want standard resume review
- You need interview preparation
- You're researching companies

- Executive function is not a barrier for you today

### Use Both Skills Together When:
- You're neurodivergent and struggle with executive function
- You need mental health support during job search
- You want automated job aggregation and filtering
- Overwhelm is preventing you from starting
- You need energy and mood tracking
- You want ND-specific company research

**+ Neurodivergent Skill:**
- ALL of the above, PLUS:
- Checks for ND-friendly indicators at company
- Flags sensory/environment concerns
- Suggests disclosure strategy
- Provides emotional support about imposter syndrome
- Tracks your energy when doing this task
- Breaks resume work into manageable chunks

```

### Example 2: Managing Low Energy Period

**User is in depressive episode:**

Morning email (ND Skill adapts):
```
Good morning - I noticed your mood has been lower this week.

Today's goal: Just review the top match. No pressure to apply.

You've applied to 8 jobs in the past 2 weeks - that's real progress. Taking it easy today is strategic, not lazy.

Top Match:
[Just one job, detailed description]

[Maybe Later] [Just Browse] [I Need a Break Today]
```

**If user clicks "I Need a Break Today":**
```
That's completely okay. Self-care is part of the process.

Your job search can wait until you're ready. No guilt.

Crisis resources (if you need them):
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

See you when you're ready. 💙
```

### Example 3: Hypomanic/High Energy Period

**User is in hypomanic episode (bipolar):**

Morning email (ND Skill recognizes pattern):
```
Good morning! Your energy seems high - that's great, but let's pace it.

Remember last time: You applied to 15 jobs in 2 days, then crashed for a week.

Today's sustainable goal: Apply to 3 jobs max

Then take a break. Your future self will thank you.

[Continue to Matches]
```

**If user tries to apply to 5th job:**
```
⚠️ Pacing check: You've already applied to 4 jobs today.

Your pattern: High energy → overcommitment → burnout

Suggestion: Save this job for tomorrow. Rest today.

[I Understand, Save for Tomorrow] [I Have Energy, Let Me Continue]
```

### Example 4: Addressing Imposter Syndrome

**User says: "I'm not qualified for this job, I'll never get it"**

**Claude response (using both skills):**

```
Let's reality-check that thought together.

The job requirements:
- 3+ years Salesforce experience ✅ YOU HAVE 2.5 years
- Service Cloud knowledge ✅ YOU HAVE Agentforce implementation experience
- Data analytics skills ✅ YOU HAVE SQL, Tableau, 99% data integrity
- Process improvement ✅ YOU HAVE 40% efficiency gains at Macquarie

Facts vs. Feelings:
- Feeling: "I'm not qualified"
- Facts: You meet 4/4 major requirements and exceed in several areas

Imposter syndrome is lying to you. The evidence says you ARE qualified.

This company would be lucky to interview you.

Want me to tailor your resume to show them why?
