    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my application for the {!Opportunity.Name} position that I submitted on {!Opportunity.Application_Prepared_Date__c}.

I remain very interested in this opportunity and would welcome the chance to discuss how my Salesforce experience and skills could contribute to your team's success.

If you need any additional information or would like to schedule a conversation, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Abby Luggery
